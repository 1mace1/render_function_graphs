# render_function_graphs
Program for render function graphics by equation of function graph. You can always help with code or ideas to improve usability of this script.

=====================================================

This program uses matplotlib, numpy and wxPython libs for rendering function graphs, so without this libs script won't work.

You have to enter f(x) function to get the function graph. An input is in infinity loop, so you can get new function graph just by closing the window of the old graph and entering new function. You can end the execution of the program by entering 'q'.

- You can use short multiply statements, <code>2x</code> instead of <code>2\*x</code> and <code>(2+x)(2-x)</code> instead of <code>(2+x)\*(2-x)</code>;
- You can use <code>^</code> or double start <code>**</code> to raise a number to the power of n;
- You have to use vertical slashes to get absolute statement. It can be like <code>|2x|</code>;
- Use trigonometrical functions like this <code>sin, cos, tan and etc</code>.
