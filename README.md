# render_function_graphs
Program for render function graphics by equation of function graph. You can always help with code or ideas to improve usability of this script.

=====================================================

This program uses matplotlib and numpy lib for rendering function graphs.

You have to enter f(x) function to get the function graph.

- You have to use double stars to raise a number to the power of n, <code>x**2</code> instead of <code>x^2</code>.
- You have to use vertical slashes to get absolute statement. It can be like <code>|2*x|</code>
- You always have to use stars to multiply values, <code>2*x</code> instead of <code>2x</code>
